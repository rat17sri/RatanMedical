        <p class="para1">The move to Electronic Medical Records has forced doctors to use new – unproven – medical reporting
            technologies that are less efficient, less accurate, more complicated and more time consuming than
            the medical dictation and transcription services that many prefer.</p>

        <br><strong>This means less time facing patients and more time facing a computer screen. Longer hours too. It doesn’t have to be this way…</strong>

            <h2>24 Hour Turnaround</h2>
            AND no more late transcription. No more delays in patient treatment.
            No more tapping the desk in the morning, waiting for the reports to pop up on the screen.
            Because delayed patient treatment makes both your patient and your referring colleague angry.
            This means less referrals and ultimately, lost business for your practice.
            With the guarantee of 24 hour turnaround on your transcription, you know your
            medical reporting won’t take your practice off schedule. So your patients will get
            your best treatment and your referring colleagues will know they can count on you
